To use this program, you have to create a file called `token_manager.py`. It's contents should be:

```python
TOKEN = "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
ACCOUNT_ID = 0000000000000000000 #your ID
```

To get a token, see https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/

Next, run in the command line `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements.

Finally, run `python3 main.py` to run the bot!
